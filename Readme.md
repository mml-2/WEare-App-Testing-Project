## WEare Social Network Testing

## Overview

This repository contains the testing project for the social network web application WEare. The application enables users to connect with others, share posts, and interact with content on a personalized feed.

The primary tasks of this project include performing functional and non-functional testing to ensure the application meets both its requirements and user expectations. Both manual and automated testing approaches have been utilized.

## Features of WEare

WEare provides the following key functionalities:

1. Connecting with People

- Add and manage connections.

- View connection recommendations.

2. Creating, Commenting, and Liking Posts

- Publish posts with text and multimedia.

- Engage with posts by liking and commenting.

3. Personalized Feed

- Get a feed of the newest and most relevant posts from your connections.

- View updates and interactions in real time.

## Testing Types

The testing process covers both functional and non-functional aspects of the application:

1. ## Functional Testing

Functional testing verifies that the application performs as expected under various scenarios. Key functional areas tested include:

User registration and login functionality.

Adding, accepting, and removing connections.

Posting, commenting, and liking workflows.

Feed generation and content relevance.

2. ## Non-Functional Testing

Non-functional testing evaluates the application's performance, reliability, usability, and other quality attributes. Key aspects tested include:

Load and stress handling during high traffic periods.

Response times for key actions such as posting and loading the feed.

Security testing to identify vulnerabilities in user data handling.

## Testing Approaches

1. ## Manual Testing

- Comprehensive test cases were created to validate core functionalities and edge cases.

- Exploratory testing was conducted to uncover unexpected issues.

2. ## Automation Testing

- Test scripts were developed using Selenium Webdriver, Postman.

- Automated regression tests ensure consistent behavior across updates.
